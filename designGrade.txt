[1/1] User has specific input to choose from, must enter one of the given options


[0/2] Have a path with at least 2 decisions on it
- nothing is clearly nested in the algorithm

[1/1] The game must make sense and have an actual story to it


[1.75/2] Proper indentation and numbering, follows rules of an algorithm
- You can't write "these will all be nested decisions." You need to actually show what is nested in your algorithm my indenting the same way we've done it in class.
- step 14 should be an otherwise, since you are checking every other case in your if and otherwise if above
