 what did you learn, what would you do differently next time, what was difficult?  This should be no more than a page.

For programming assignment number 2.I learned how to use input & output to make decisions.I also learned how to format
conditional statements not only in my code but in my algorithm as well .While working on the program it was extremely
difficult for me how to nest certain if statements into others but I rectified this problem by referencing my notes and
asking for help.I also thought it was challenging to draw the flow chart  for the different paths of the program since in my
particular program there were various paths.I think that in the future i'll physically write on paper what aspects
i'll need and want in my code and  what my decisions will possibly  be so that I have an idea of how I will attempt
to start the program design process on the computer itself.Additionally it would help me be more organized before I attempt
to write my algorithm,or draw my flow chart.In this lab I had more practice with typecasting which I liked and I
also had programming practice with different boolean operators and creating boolean expressions as well as
comparing variables .To add on to that I realized that just like in pa 1 that that programming as an individual requires
close attention to detail as it helps prevent less syntax errors or simple mistakes such as spelling.In pa-2 it was extremely crucial to pay attention and make sure that
the format was correct and that everything was being type casted properly and that expressions were being written properly
because in a multi step program such as this one one small mistake can effect the entire program.
